MotionPlanning
==============

State first: the code cannot be referred.

It is a project in my first-year graduate student in Dartmouth College.


Use Probabilistic Roadmap(PRM) to help a planar robot arm plan motions to get the goal. Use Exploring Random Tree(RRT) to help a steered car plan motions to achieve the final status. Details are in report.
